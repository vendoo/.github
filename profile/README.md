# About Vendoo

Vendoo is a minority-owned startup consisting of four young entrepreneurs from the Washington, DC area. Our CEO, Thomas Rivas, identified a void in the market and decided to create Vendoo while experiencing the usual pain points of trying to sell items on multiple marketplaces. After the team was assembled, we began building the software in 2017. Each team member has a different skill set, from full-time reselling experience to software development, and provides a unique perspective on how to solve the common inconveniences of the reselling experience.

## Our Vision 

At Vendoo, our vision is to be the #1 reselling tool in the world. We are creating a software that will allow resellers to run their business more efficiently by providing convenience at every step of the process, from sourcing inventory to shipping orders. We want sellers to be able to fully run their business across multiple marketplaces without having to leave our site.

## We are hiring!
